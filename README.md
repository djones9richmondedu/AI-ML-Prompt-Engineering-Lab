# AI-ML-Prompt-Engineering-Lab

Prompt Engineering Assignment
Overview
In this assignment, you will apply prompt engineering techniques to generate a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for a company of your choice within your desired field of work. You will explore job postings on Indeed.com to select a company, use multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) available to you to generate SWOT analyses, and refine your prompts iteratively to improve outcomes, culminating in a final revision that ties your field of study to an interview context. This lab focuses on the process of achieving a high-quality result through experimentation and comparison, resulting in a polished deliverable set.

Mission Statement of the Federal Reserve (From Inception)
The Federal Reserve System was established by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Its original mission, as outlined in the Act, was to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and stable monetary and financial system. Specifically, the Federal Reserve was created to:

   -   Serve as a central bank to manage the nation’s currency, money supply, and interest rates.
   -   Provide and maintain an effective and efficient payments system.
   -   Supervise and regulate banking institutions to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation’s banking and financial system.
   -   Act as a lender of last resort to prevent financial panics.
   -   Promote economic stability by mitigating financial crises and supporting employment and price stability.

Over time, the Federal Reserve’s mission has been refined, particularly with the formal adoption of a dual mandate in 1977 (amended in the Federal Reserve Reform Act), which emphasizes:

   -   Maximum employment: Promoting conditions that foster job creation and low unemployment.
Stable prices: Maintaining low and stable inflation.

   -   Moderate long-term interest rates: Supporting economic growth through stable financial conditions.
This mission is carried out through monetary policy, bank supervision, and financial services.



Mission Statement of the Richmond Fed
The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, as one of the 12 regional Reserve Banks, aligns its mission with the broader Federal Reserve System but tailors it to its role within the Fifth Federal Reserve District. Its mission statement is:

   -   To strengthen the economy and communities by fostering the stability, integrity, and efficiency of the nation’s monetary, financial, and payments systems.
