# AI-ML-Prompt-Engineering-Lab

Prompt Engineering Assignment
Overview
In this assignment, you will apply prompt engineering techniques to generate a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for a company of your choice within your desired field of work. You will explore job postings on Indeed.com to select a company, use multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) available to you to generate SWOT analyses, and refine your prompts iteratively to improve outcomes, culminating in a final revision that ties your field of study to an interview context. This lab focuses on the process of achieving a high-quality result through experimentation and comparison, resulting in a polished deliverable set.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lab, you will:
Understand iterative prompt engineering tailored to real-world scenarios.
Compare accessible LLMs for practical tasks.
Apply your field of study to an interview-relevant SWOT analysis.
Develop skills in documenting and presenting work using GitHub.
